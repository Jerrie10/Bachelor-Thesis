# Bachelor Thesis Program

Hello
This repository contains all data and programs used for my Bachelor Thesis.

Most scripts are taken from [this](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/social-transit) GitHub page by Adam Rumpf. He made a C++ program to make health services in Chicago more accessible by bus. I'm trying to apply his method to the health services in Leiden.

To do this, GTFS data about bus travel in the Netherlands is included. Scripts that weed out data that is irrelevent for my scope are going to be made and included.
